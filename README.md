# Heart Attack Prediction ❤️🔬

This project predicts the risk of a heart attack using patient health records and classification algorithms.

## 📌 Key Highlights
- Data preprocessing and feature selection based on clinical relevance.
- Trained classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
- Deployed a Streamlit app for users to input health data and get risk predictions.
